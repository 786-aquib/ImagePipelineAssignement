# Canvas Drawing Tool with Mask Generation

This project is a React-based canvas editor that enables users to upload images, draw freehand, and generate mask images. It leverages the `fabric.js` library for managing the canvas and drawing operations. The mask generation feature is designed to create a binary mask (black background with white strokes) of user-drawn paths.
